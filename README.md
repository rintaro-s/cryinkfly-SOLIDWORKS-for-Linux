SolidWorks is a CAD software that can be used to create parametric models, assemblies, and drawings. It's typical to work with relationships (the alignment of elements with one another) and dimensions (alignment through values).

You get this program for systems that have Windows or macOS installed.

But the problem is that there are also people like me who don't want to use either of these two operating systems on their systems. Then these users have installed a Linux distribution such as openSUSE Leap, Ubuntu or Fedora.

And so I got the idea to start this project here to find a way to solve this problem. 

I started looking at different tools and my choice was Wine! 

With this nice tool we don't need longer two operating systems for Solidworks, when you want to create simple FEM, fluid and motion simulations.

Is that a great idea for the future?

Personally, I think this idea is good and for this reason I will do my best to give you the opportunity to use it on Linux as well!

## Downloads

There are some [script releases](https://github.com/cryinkfly/SOLIDWORKS-Linux-Wine-Version-/tree/main/scripts) available, built from the release targets.

It's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Development builds are available here if you need it, but correspondingly may be less stable.

---

## Hardware and Software Requirements

- Internet connection (Cable/DSL speeds recommended)
- Latest Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, Debian, Manjaro, openSUSE Leap, fully updated

## Getting Started

Install Solidworks for Linux client:

1.) Check my <a href="https://github.com/cryinkfly/SOLIDWORKS-Linux-Wine-Version-/wiki/Documentation">GitHub-Documentation</a> before you install Solidworks on your system!

2.) Open a terminal and run this command:

    cd ~/Downloads && wget -N https://github.com/cryinkfly/SOLIDWORKS-for-Linux/raw/main/scripts/stable-branch/solidworks-install.sh && chmod +x solidworks-install.sh && bash solidworks-install.sh && exit

3.) Please check this [issue](https://github.com/cryinkfly/SOLIDWORKS-Linux-Wine-Version-/issues/3) if the installation hangs up by installing the language files!

*Notice: Script is still in progress!!!
